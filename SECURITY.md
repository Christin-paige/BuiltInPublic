## 🛠 Found a Security Issue?

If you’ve discovered a vulnerability or something that doesn’t look quite right, we’d really appreciate it if you let us know privately.

**Please don’t open a public issue.**  
Instead, reach out to us at:

📧 **christinpmartin@gmail.com**

When reporting, include as much detail as you can:

- What you found and where
- How to reproduce it (if possible)
- Any ideas for how it could be fixed (optional but appreciated)

## 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽 Our Disclosure Approach

We follow a responsible disclosure process:

1. You let us know privately.
2. We investigate and confirm the issue.
3. We collaborate on a fix.
4. Once resolved, we publish the patch and optionally credit you.

We’re all about community here. If you want to be credited, we’re happy to highlight your contribution in our release notes.

## 🔐 Secure Contributions

Helping us build BuiltInPublic? Amazing. Please take a look at our [CONTRIBUTORS.md](./CONTRIBUTORS.md#secure-coding-practices) to see our secure coding expectations.

You don’t have to be a security expert, just keeping an eye out for common pitfalls helps a lot.

## 🧭 Supported Versions

We currently support the latest version of the `development` branch. Security fixes will be released for that version unless otherwise noted.

Thanks for being part of the community, and for helping us keep things safe for everyone.
