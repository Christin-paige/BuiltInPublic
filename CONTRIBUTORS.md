## ‚ú® Code Style & Practices

- Use consistent formatting (Prettier, ESLint, etc.)
- Break large features into small, reviewable chunks
- Avoid pushing commented-out code or unrelated changes
- Write meaningful commit messages (e.g., `fix: sanitize user input in form`)

## üîê Secure Coding Practices

We care deeply about security and ask that you keep the following principles in mind when contributing:

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Character Encoding:**  
  Always specify and enforce UTF-8 for all input sources to prevent encoding-related attacks.

- **Validation Techniques:**  
  Use *allow-list validation* for input‚Äîonly accept what you expect. Check data types, ranges, and lengths before processing.

- **Sanitize Outputs:**  
  Escape and sanitize user input when outputting it to the DOM, APIs, command line, or database.

### General Secure Development Practices

- **Secrets Handling:**  
  Never commit API keys, tokens, or sensitive info. Use `.env` files and ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`.

- **Avoid Injection:**  
  Use parameterized queries and avoid string concatenation in SQL or shell commands.

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  If your changes interact with user accounts or permissions, think about least privilege and access control.

- **Log Carefully:**  
  Don‚Äôt log anything sensitive like passwords, tokens, or personally identifiable data.

### Bonus Points

We love when contributors go the extra mile by:

- Adding unit tests
- Updating related documentation
- Leaving inline comments explaining tricky logic
